# Bio
I am currently an Agronomy Ph.D. Candidate at the University of  Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). My research focuses on evaluating the economic and environmental implications of nitrogen management technologies. My project involves using remote sensing and crop model-based decision support tools to enhance nitrogen recommendations for wheat producers in  Nebraska. Committed to sustainable agriculture, I strive to bridge scientific research with practical solutions to improve farming efficiency and environmental stewardship. I anticipate graduating in  December 2024 and am seeking job opportunities as a research agronomist in the industry.
